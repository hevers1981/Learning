This repository is for files I have created in my quest to learn BASH script programming, 
and for anyone else who wishes to contribute to the learning of anyone else freely.

I fully support the open source community and as I am new to it I shall attempt to
do my best in learning how to program, and freely exchange my ideas with other in
hopes that we might all grow in our knowledge and contributions to the POSIX community
together.
